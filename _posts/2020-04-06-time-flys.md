A lot of things have happened in the last few months that have me thinking deeply about time. One of my best friends passed away unexpectedly and I have been quite consumed with thoughts of our conversations and time together before his death. Now the COVID-19 (Corona virus) pandemic finds me unemployed and with an abundance of newfound time with my family at home.

I have been experimenting and learning more with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as I really prefer it as a front-end javascript framework over others I have used. I was showing one of my experiments to my son and he reminded me of a codepen I created a few months ago that I had completely forgotten. Check out this analog clock I made completely with HTML, SCSS, and Vue.
