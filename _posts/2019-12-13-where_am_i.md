Sometimes, you just need to know where you are. IRL you can check a map or a GPS if you're lucky. But in the world of computers and networks, you often need to know the IP address of your network as it appears to the outside world. One of my favorite linux commands to run is:

```
dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com
```

Let’s break that down:
- **dig** is a DNS lookup utility, and it stands for “domain information grouper”.*
- **+short** asks for a non-verbose answer.
- **myip.opendns.com** is the domain we ask about.
- **@resolver1.opendns.com** is the DNS server that we ask.

So what this command does is: it sends an request for the IP of the domain `myip.opendns.com` to the DNS server `resolver1.opendns.com`. This server is programmed so that if _this special domain_ is requested, the IP the request comes from is sent back.

I often end up wrapping that line in a shell script and make a file called **get_external_ip.sh** that looks like:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com
```

Now whenever I need to know where this box is relative to the rest of the Internet, I can quickly run `./get_external_ip.sh` and see the WAN IP immediately. Neato! 😎

_* If you can't `dig`, try to `sudo apt-get install dnsutils` or your equivalent._
