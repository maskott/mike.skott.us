One of my favorite linux commands to run is:

```
dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com
```

Let’s break that down:
- **dig** is a DNS lookup utility, and it stands for “domain information grouper”.
- **+short** asks for a non-verbose answer.
- **myip.opendns.com** is the domain we ask about.
- **@resolver1.opendns.com** is the DNS server that we ask.

So what this command does is: it sends an request for the IP of the domain `myip.opendns.com` to the DNS server `resolver1.opendns.com`. This server is programmed so that if _this special domain_ is requested, the IP the request comes from is sent back.

I often end up wrapping that line in a shell script and make a file called **get_external_ip.sh** that looks like:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com
```

Now whenever I need to know where this box is relative to the rest of the Internet, I can quickly run `./get_external_ip.sh` and see the WAN IP immediately. Neato! 😎
