Are you a lazy developer like me? Would you go to ~~great~~ medium lengths merely to save a few keystrokes? My awesome devops friend Dopamine taught me this little ditty. In the `.bashrc` file, include an alias to source your common shell logins like so:

```
alias sauce='source ~/.bashrc; source ~/.bash_aliases; source ~/.profile;'
```
 You may need to adjust for your distribution and usage, but now you can lazily source your new aliases and get lost in the `sauce`!
